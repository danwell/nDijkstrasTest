This is an example of an implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm for
calculating movement ranges on a 2D grid.

Run it as follows:
	mono ./nDijkstrasTest.exe [MAP]

where MAP is one of the the included map files. The program will read
the map file and print out the movement ranges for each of the 'S'
characters. How far these characters can move is determined by the
surrounding terrain types and whether they are being obstructed by 'R'
characters, who will obstruct the movement of 'S' characters.
