This is an example of an implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm for
calculating movement ranges on a 2D grid.

One popular staple of turn-based games using a 2D grid, such as Advance
Wars or Shining Force, is the tatical movement and placement of units.
Smart placement can gain you advantageous ground, avoid attacks and
even give you the initiative. This is an example of an algorithm for
determining movement range for a given tile based on surrounding tiles
and movement costs.

Run it as follows:
	mono ./nDijkstrasTest.exe [MAP]

where MAP is one of the the included map files. The program will read
the map file and print out the movement ranges for each of the 'S'
characters. How far these characters can move is determined by the
surrounding terrain types and whether they are being obstructed by 'R'
characters, who will obstruct the movement of 'S' characters.
